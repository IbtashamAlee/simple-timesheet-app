# For testing the app you can do the following steps

In the main project directory and client-app directory, you can run:

### 1. `npm install`

In main directory, you can run the following command to run the project:

### 1. `npm run start-dev`

Goto client-app directory and run:

### 1. `npm run start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### Please describe your process for approaching the code challenge. What kind of planning did you do? Did your plans change as you began coding?

First of all I thought the problem complexity for both frontend and backend. I understood the problem and thought about its hurdles that i could face while doing obviously some were known hurdles.
1. I planned to write the backend first after setting up the base of project.
2. I planned to write user authentication first than move to timesheet apis.

Yes, It sometimes changes because when problem is known you don't know the hurdles and exact
process of doing. So, when you face a problem than sometimes plan seem to be change because we need to reduce the 
problem complexity and save time.

### Describe the schema design you chose. Why did you choose this design? What other alternatives did you consider?
   
1. The schema is basic, yet a lil bit technical. User will create an account or login (if already created an account)
.It stores the used id with every time sheet document in the database according to
normalization process. Then we can fetch timesheets, adds new clock in, clock out time. And, also it will store the date accordingly.

2. According to requirements given, I wrote this schema design.

3. For a basic app, it is a good schemas design. But if we go to a large level it will definitely improve and change.


### If you were given another day to work on this, how would you spend it? What if you were given a month?

1. For an extra day, I will improve my existing app.

2. If I were given a month, I will spend 2 3 days thinking about the problem
complexity, database schema, best tools, technology stack required to solve the problem and plan the steps to reach the success.
I will think about exciting features and spend a good time on 
creating a very well and attractive user interface. Test the product by myself for detecting bugs in software and fix them for giving user a 
very good experience.
